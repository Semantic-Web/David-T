Description of Experiment:
-----
Compare multiple Metropolitan Statistical demographic areas with various metrics and analyze which areas are seeing more improvements. 

Areas to Compare:
------
20 Largest Metrolpitan Statistical Areas: -	Note: The estimates are based on the 2010 Census and reflect changes to the April 1, 2010 population due to the Count Question Resolution program and geographic program revisions. 
See Geographic Terms and Definitions at http://www.census.gov/popest/about/geo/terms.html for a list of the states that are included in each region and division. 
All geographic boundaries for the 2014 population estimates series except statistical area delineations are as of January 1, 2014. 
The Office of Management and Budget's statistical area delineations for metropolitan, micropolitan, and combined statistical areas, as well as metropolitan divisions, are those issued by that agency in February 2013 http://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/omb/bulletins/2013/b13-01.pdf.

What to identify:
-----------
-	Identify the differences between these demographic areas and classify which demographic metrics determine certain outcomes for each area. 
-	Ex. Does a low educational rate determine the poverty or crime rate?
-	Ex. Does a low poverty rate determine the crime or mortality rate?
-	Ex. Does race play a factor in which areas have higher or lower demographic metrics?
  o	Ex. Is the crime rate higher where there is a larger number of minorities?
  o	Ex. Is the poverty rate higher where there is a larger number of minorities?
-	Ex. Does the population of residents in these areas determine certain outcomes?
-	Ex. Are all of these metrics dependent or independent from one another?
-	Ex. Does the diversity in races determine the 



Data Analysis Performed:
-------------------------
To find the infant mortality rate for each race, I had to first find the infant population for each race across the US to use as a base denominator. 
Secondly, I had to find the number of total infant deaths for each race. The number of total deaths divided by the total number of births(infant population)
returned the mortality rate for each race.   


Identify the perceptions and realities of these areas and statistics?
-------
-	A detailed scope beyond the newspaper headlines is critical if we are to find out where the genuine problems are. 
-	Public perceptions matter, especially as government agendas and policies are inevitably shaped by the concerns and attitudes of society.  -	
- Ex. Is it true that people remain in poverty because they are lazy?
-	Ex. Itâ€™s perceived that blacks are lazy, is this reality?

What are the racial perceptions of Crime in America?
-	Overestimating Black and Hispanic Crime Rates
-	Implicit Biases About People of Color

What drives public perceptions of crime?
-	Demographic Factors
-	There are significant demographic variations in perceptions of government performance on crime. 
  Research using simple analyses shows that older groups, those without qualifications, and those living in very affluent areas hold more negative views. 
  Those more likely to hold positive views include the youngest groups, those with the highest qualifications, those living in the most deprived areas, and those from minority ethnic groups, particularly Asian. 

Show and explain the overall results of the analysis.
