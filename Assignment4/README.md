Assignment 4:
Note - Assignment still missing Short Paper and Data Analytics  
Description:
-----------
Essentially DCAT will allow us to find all related data across multiple data.gov/ federal data sites. 
Try to find related data across databases (see data.gov)  to answer  slightly complicated questions. 
For example, you will have to use census data to find ethnic backgrounds and ages in various US regions and data from HealthData.gov on mortality and morbidity rates, 
or data on educational institutions (via data.gov) . 
Then, pose some question such as: Is health or education coverage worse in some regions and relate it to data from the US Census Bureau. 
This is just a suggestion. The idea is to use DCAT front-end to access data from two government data sets, as per your passion and background, 
and relate them using simple data analytics. A simple data analytic is to find the average for the entire US and define arbitrarily half that of that as the threshold  to define under-coverage, 
or one--and-a-half that value as the threshold to define over-coverage. 
The primary goal here is to integrate data across two data sets, using the DCAT interface. 
Any simple type of data analytics is fine. Do screen captures, and upload the code, screen captures, and a short paper to Github.

Requirements:
-------------
In order to run this project you need to import ["TestNG"](http://testng.org/doc/index.html) library and the "Jena" library.  

Experiment:
-----------
Comparing 2 Datasets
- 1st Dataset from Data.gov includes "Estimates of the population by age, sex, race, and Hispanic origin for the nation, states, and counties" ;
- 2nd Dataset from HealthCare.gov includes "Mortality Rate By Region" ;
