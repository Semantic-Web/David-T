Midterm Description:
---------------------
Write  a 3 to 5 page report (single spaced, regular margins) that outlines your proposal for the project. 
If working together, indicate so in the report. Both of you should submit both at Github and BB.

Essentially, this is your planning document that details the objectives to be met and how you propose to achieve the same. 
It will use one or more .owl/.rdf files for meta data/schema. I
nstance data could come from .csv (or similar) formatted data files. 
Items to include: names of schemas and databases to use and links to the same; tools and languages to use; inputs and outputs; and significance/usefulness of your project. 
Develop a flow for your project development. Invest some time to fully understand, do some preliminary exploration, and to anticipate problems/challenges in completing your project. 
Document all of that. You only have 3 weeks beyond this exam deadline to finish the project. I will let you know if it is not appropriate for this course, but that will come only 2 weeks before the semester ends. 
So, talk to me now and follow the instructions - so, you can avoid surprises later on.
