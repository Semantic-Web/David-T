"Table 3 describes characteristics of law enforcement homicides reported to either the SHR or the ARD program by match score. As expected, law enforcement homicide victims with an unknown age are more likely to have no match. Law enforcement homicide victims that are identified as white, non-Hispanic (75%) are most likely to have a no match compared to other race/Hispanic origin groups, while victims of an “other” race are most likely to have a certainty match (26%) compared to unknown or other unspecified race/Hispanic origin groups.",,
