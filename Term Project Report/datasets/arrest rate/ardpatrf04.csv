"The methodology for identifying ARD cases has changed over the observation period, and",,
"figure 4 suggests that the methods used in more recent years are associated with better coverage. To better understand the methodologies used to identify arrest-related deaths in 2011, RTI conducted interviews with state reporting coordinators (SRCs). These interviews explored the primary method each SRC used for identifying cases, whether direct reporting from law enforcement agencies was involved, and whether the SRCs conducted any sort of follow-up or verification of cases reported to them. In addition, RTI tracked information about reporting methods and SRC location throughout the 2011 data collection period. This information was used to further examine the utility of various methodologies for identifying arrest-related deaths, as implemented by the SRCs during the 2011 data collection.",,
"The remaining analyses examine differences in case matching by state and reporting method. RTI grouped states by the primary data collection methodology and the location of the SRCs. Then, RTI conducted analyses to compare the number of cases reported only to ARD, only to SHR, or to both programs. Because the methodology for reporting was determined largely through the SRC interviews and information gained during the 2011 data collection period, these analyses are limited to 2011 data only. Table 7 describes state-level variation in reporting. In 2011, 83% of law enforcement homicides reported to either system were estimated to be captured in the ARD program. Approximately 139 of the estimated 828 law enforcement homicides captured by either system were reported only to the SHR.",,
